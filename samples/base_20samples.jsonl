I hope this isn't too trivial of a question to ask on here, but I've been feeling a bit out of my depth when it comes to this situation (I've had only one relationship before, and for many reasons, it was out of the ordinary).\n\nOkay! So, a couple of weeks ago, I started talking to this guy on Facebook, through a student group that we were both part of. I thought he was sort of cute, so I sent him a PM just to talk, etc, etc. We're both transfer students at the same school, so I knew that we could eventually meet in person once we both moved on-campus. So, we did, and we hung out maybe twice, just as friends.\n\nOkay. So, everything is going pretty well. We talk over Facebook and Snapchat, whatever. So, Saturday night, I was just hanging out with people and kind of being bored, when I got a Snapchat from him asking what I was doing. I asked if he wanted to hang out, so we did. \n\nWe ended up smoking pot (the first time for me, ever), and sort of just wandering around. Eventually we ended up back at his dorm room, where high me decided to just go for it, and I came on to him pretty strongly. It worked out for me (luckily, otherwise things would have been really super awkward), and we ended up messing around but not having sex.\n\nYesterday, however, I ended up going to hang out with him again, and this time we did sleep together. Afterward, we kind of discussed what we were going to do, and he just said that he wanted to \"play it by ear\" and not slap any labels on anything. I'm wondering if this means that he wants a fwb-type situation, or if he might actually be interested in me. The way I've been acting is extremely out of character for me, and I am not interested in having a fuck buddy. I like him, and I would be very interested in maybe seeing where things go, but I'm worried that I may have ruined my chances of a relationship by sleeping with him already.\n\nTL;DR:", "model_output": "The poster, a 19-year-old woman, is unsure if she has jeopardized a potential relationship with her 19-year-old male friend after sleeping with him. |eotonly.your.<|", "ground_truth": "I really like this guy, but after having sex with him after only knowing him for a very brief period of time, I am worried that I may have ruined my chances of a relationship with him."}

Vacuuming was my job, and I was doing a damn good job (IMO). I should inform you that we have one of those Dyson Cyclone vacuums that has the cylinder that you detach and then press the button to empty from the bottom. So I detach the cylinder and hold it over the trash bag to empty. I press the button-dust, dirt and hair ALL OVER the floor while only a small amount made it into the bag. I curse silently, turn the vacuum back on and go to work. I had gotten most of it back into the vacuum when the garbage bag was caught by the vacuum and tipped over, spilling the rest of the vacuum's prior contents onto the floor. I cursed again (not silently this time) and cleaned the rest of it up.

I looked up my plan and had 5gbs of data left and two days in my plan. I didn't want to waste it so I googled how much data streaming a movie would take and it said 1-3gbs so I decided to use my phone as a hotspot and watch I'm Still Here on Netflix. Woke up in the morning to a $150 fee added to my $40 phone bill. I called them and the guy I spoke to initially estimated 3-4gbs for a movie, but when I pointed out I had apparently used 7 he thought that was normal too. He straight away said he could get half of the bill knocked off, and I just agreed to that because I (clearly) am not very technologically informed. I guess I'm just frustrated that their automatic setting for going over your data is to charge you $70 a gb instead of just adding their $10 1gb data pack to your plan and then they can't even text me to let me know until I've already blown through $150 worth. I received 3 emails (even though they manage to text me about paying my bill) about four hours after I watched the movie saying I was 50%, 75% and 100% over my data limit, and then another few hours later finally got a text saying I'd used all my data.
