I hope this isn't too trivial of a question to ask on here, but I've been feeling a bit out of my depth when it comes to this situation (I've had only one relationship before, and for many reasons, it was out of the ordinary).\n\nOkay! So, a couple of weeks ago, I started talking to this guy on Facebook, through a student group that we were both part of. I thought he was sort of cute, so I sent him a PM just to talk, etc, etc. We're both transfer students at the same school, so I knew that we could eventually meet in person once we both moved on-campus. So, we did, and we hung out maybe twice, just as friends.\n\nOkay. So, everything is going pretty well. We talk over Facebook and Snapchat, whatever. So, Saturday night, I was just hanging out with people and kind of being bored, when I got a Snapchat from him asking what I was doing. I asked if he wanted to hang out, so we did. \n\nWe ended up smoking pot (the first time for me, ever), and sort of just wandering around. Eventually we ended up back at his dorm room, where high me decided to just go for it, and I came on to him pretty strongly. It worked out for me (luckily, otherwise things would have been really super awkward), and we ended up messing around but not having sex.\n\nYesterday, however, I ended up going to hang out with him again, and this time we did sleep together. Afterward, we kind of discussed what we were going to do, and he just said that he wanted to \"play it by ear\" and not slap any labels on anything. I'm wondering if this means that he wants a fwb-type situation, or if he might actually be interested in me. The way I've been acting is extremely out of character for me, and I am not interested in having a fuck buddy. I like him, and I would be very interested in maybe seeing where things go, but I'm worried that I may have ruined my chances of a relationship by sleeping with him already.\n\nTL;DR:", "ground_truth": "I really like this guy, but after having sex with him after only knowing him for a very brief period of time, I am worried that I may have ruined my chances of a relationship with him.", "summary_base": "The poster, a 19-year-old woman, is unsure if she has jeopardized a potential relationship with her 19-year-old male friend after sleeping with him. |eotonly.your.<|", "summary_lora": "The poster, a 19-year-old woman, is unsure if she may have messed up her chances with a guy she's developing feelings for by sleeping with him after initial casual interactions.", "score_base": 4, "score_lora": 5, "winner": "B", "reasoning": "Summary B better captures the nuance of the poster's developing feelings and the context of 'initial casual interactions,' aligning more closely with the post's emphasis on romantic interest and fear of a FWB dynamic.

After the ceremony everyone walks outside the building and onto the other side of the small road the hearses drive down.

So of course as someone who is an avid football (soccer if you're American) player my first instinct is to stick my foot out and kind of control her head like you would with a football.\n\nOf course you can imagine this looked horrendously bad on my part (quite literally kicking an old woman while she's down) and as she got up everyone noticed that her nose was completely grey/black as if she'd just been punched in the face. She assures us she's fine and we go to the dinner afterwards where someone finally informs her of her bruising.

As a result, the selection of locally grown fruit is phenomenal.

I keep telling myself that I only have to make it to 1 o' clock, then I can just go to bed. Easier said than done, but I finally get home and find little success in napping.

The (sort of) short version of the chain of events is this. Last year he fell in the shower then didn't go to the doctor. For about the next 3 days he got weaker and more tired. He started hallucinating (seeing his dead brother in the room, etc.) so my mom got him to the hospital. He had lost a lot of blood through presumably some internal bleeding. They got more blood in him and stabilized so after a week he went home. He recovered pretty well.\n\nFast forward to October and one morning he couldn't get up off the couch, had no energy and was looking really bad, so back to the hospital he goes. He spent two weeks there this time (and had to miss my brother's wedding) because it was an infection in his blood and it took a while to get the right antibiotics in him to knock out the infection.\n\nThree days ago my dad was back in the hospital again for being weak and hallucinating.
